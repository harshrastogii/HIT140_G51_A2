Bat vs. Rat: The Forage Files

HIT140 Foundations of Data Science - Assessment 2

##Project Overview
This repository contains our team's analysis investigating whether Egyptian Fruit Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) perceive Black Rats (Rattus rattus) as potential predators rather than just competitors for food. Our research examines bat foraging behavior and vigilance patterns in the presence of rats using real-world observational data.

Research Question (Investigation A)
Q. Do bats perceive rats not just as competitors for food but also as potential predators?

We hypothesize that if rats are perceived as a predation risk, bats will demonstrate:
Increased avoidance behavior
1. Higher vigilance levels during foraging
2. Altered timing patterns when approaching food platforms
