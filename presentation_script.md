###HARSH RASTOGI (2.5 minutes) - Introduction & Research Question

"Hello, I'm Harsh Rastogi, and today our team is presenting our analysis of bat foraging behaviour in the presence of rats.
Background: Egyptian Fruit Bats and Black Rats compete for food resources, but the question we're investigating goes deeper than simple competition.

Research Question: Do bats perceive rats not just as competitors for food, but as potential predators?
If bats view rats as predatory threats, we would expect to see specific behavioural patterns - namely increased avoidance behaviour and higher vigilance when rats are present.

Our Datasets: We analysed two datasets containing 907 individual bat landing events and over 2,000 observation periods from a 7-month study. Each dataset captures different aspects of this complex predator-prey dynamic.

This investigation is scientifically important because it helps us understand how animals perceive threats in their environment and adapt their foraging strategies accordingly."
 
###RENISH (2.5 minutes) - Data & Methodology

"I'm Renish, and I'll explain our data and analytical approach.

Dataset 1 contains 907 individual bat landing events with 12 variables including timing, risk behaviour, and foraging success. Dataset 2 provides broader context with 2,123 thirty-minute observation periods.

Key Variables: Our analysis focused on three critical measurements:
•	Risk behaviour: Whether bats avoided confrontation (0) or engaged in risk-taking behaviour (1)
•	Reward success: Whether bats successfully obtained food
•	Timing patterns: How long bats took to approach food platforms

Methodology: We conducted both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. First, we examined success rates and timing patterns between risk-taking and risk-avoiding bats. Then we applied chi-square testing to determine if observed differences were statistically significant.

Data Quality: We found minimal missing data - only 41 missing values in one variable out of 907 observations, indicating high-quality research data that supports reliable conclusions."
 
###HENA AKTER (2.5 minutes) - Results & Visualizations

"I'm Hena Akter, presenting our key findings and visualizations.

Major Discovery: Our analysis revealed a dramatic difference in foraging success between bat behavioural strategies.

Success Rates:
•	Risk-avoiding bats: 84.3% success rate (386 successful out of 458 attempts)
•	Risk-taking bats: 21.8% success rate (98 successful out of 449 attempts)

This means risk-avoiding bats are four times more successful than those that confront rats directly.

Timing Analysis: Risk-avoiding bats also approached food faster - averaging 7.12 seconds compared to 16.39 seconds for risk-taking bats.
Statistical Significance: Our chi-square test produced a statistic of 352.83 with a p-value less than 0.000001, indicating these differences are highly statistically significant - not due to chance.

[Show visualization] This chart clearly illustrates the stark difference in success rates, providing visual evidence for our conclusions.
 
###PRINCY (2.5 minutes) - Conclusions & Implications

"Thank you Hena. I'm Princy, and I'll synthesize our findings to answer our research question and discuss the broader scientific implications of our discoveries.

Direct Answer to Investigation A: Based on our comprehensive statistical analysis, we can confidently answer 'Yes' - there is strong empirical evidence that bats perceive rats not merely as food competitors, but as potential predators. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence from our data analysis.

Evidence Integration: The 84% versus 22% success rate difference is not just statistically significant - it represents a survival advantage so substantial that it suggests powerful evolutionary pressures have shaped this behavioural response. When one behavioural strategy is four times more effective than another, it indicates that the animals have developed sophisticated threat assessment capabilities that extend beyond simple resource competition.

Evolutionary Implications: This finding suggests that over evolutionary time, bats that developed better predator recognition and risk assessment abilities had significant survival advantages. The risk-avoidance behaviour we observed likely represents an adaptive strategy that has been refined through natural selection. Bats that could accurately assess when rats posed predatory threats versus when they were merely competing for food would have been more successful foragers.

Behavioural Ecology Significance: Our research contributes to the growing understanding that animals don't just react to immediate physical threats - they engage in complex cost-benefit analyses of potential risks. The fact that risk-avoiding bats were also faster suggests that perceived predation risk actually enhances rather than impedes foraging efficiency when properly managed.

Study Limitations and Future Directions: While our findings are statistically robust, they represent one temporal period and specific environmental conditions. Future research could examine whether these patterns persist across different seasons, as mentioned in Investigation B of the original research brief. Additionally, examining whether similar patterns exist in other bat-rodent interactions could validate the generalizability of our findings.

Conservation Implications: Understanding these predator-prey perceptions becomes increasingly important as habitat modifications affect natural foraging environments. If bats rely on specific behavioural strategies to coexist with potential predators, habitat changes that alter these dynamics could have unexpected consequences for bat populations.

Methodological Contributions: Our analysis demonstrates the value of combining detailed behavioural observation with rigorous statistical analysis. The dramatic effect size we discovered might have been overlooked with less comprehensive analytical approaches.

In conclusion, our investigation provides compelling evidence that Egyptian Fruit Bats have evolved sophisticated predator recognition abilities that allow them to distinguish between competitive and predatory threats, resulting in adaptive behavioural strategies that significantly enhance their foraging success and survival prospects."
